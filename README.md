# hello-world
My first repository.
Now edited first time.

This is a short discription of mine:

1. Working hard makes me happy.
2. I know what I will do today and what I shall tomorrow.
3. In addition to that I have a clear idea of what to achieve say in one month/year.
4. My happiness increases as in when I accomplish the desired task.
5. More importantly I trust myself because I know myself.
6. I feel attention is one of the top charteristic of an individual.
7. I know just enough about life that it keeps me guessing the surprise it has for me.
8. And yes my motivation are my parents.
